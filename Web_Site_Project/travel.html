      <p class="item_p">Complete your London experience with a ride in one of the city's black cabs. London's official taxis, black cabs can be hailed in the street or at designated ranks situated in prominent places, including many mainline rail, Tube and bus stations. They can also be booked by telephone.

        If the yellow TAXI sign at the front is illuminated, the cab is available for hire. Black cabs are legally obliged to take on any job for journeys up to 12 miles (20 miles for cabs at the Heathrow Airport taxi ranks), or up to one-hour duration.

        London cabs fares and tips

        Fares are metered, and there is a minimum charge of £3.20. Additional charges apply when you take a black cab from Heathrow, book by telephone, and on Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. All black cabs accept payment by credit or debit card, and there is no surcharge on the taxi fare for card payment.

        You can tip taxi drivers as much as you like, but most people round up to the nearest pound.

        London buses are card only, so no need for cash.

        Choose a Visitor Oyster card, an Oyster card, a Travelcard or a contactless payment card to pay your fare.

        A single London bus journey costs £1.55 no matter how far you go (unlike the Tube zone fare system). You can even take multiple buses within one hour at no extra charge thanks to the Hopper fare system. Plus, no matter how many buses or trams you take, it will never cost you more than £4.65 a day. Just make sure you use the same payment option across every journey.

        For contactless payment cards issued outside the UK, it's best to check with your card issuer as transaction fees or bank charges may apply.

        Paying your fare is very easy - simply touch your payment card of choice on the yellow card reader as you board the bus, or show the driver your paper Travelcard. To avoid card clash, make sure to only touch one card on the yellow reader, and to keep your other cards separate.

        If you don’t have enough credit on your Visitor Oyster card or Oyster card, you will be able to make one more journey on a bus before needing to top up.

        For more information about London bus fares, see the Transport for London website.

        Still not sure which travel ticket you need to buy? Unclear on how to use your Visitor Oyster card? Read our Oyster FAQs section for the answer to these and other Oyster-related questions.

        London's public bike-sharing scheme, Santander Cycles, is available 24/7, 365 days a year.

        There are more than 750 docking stations and 11,500 bikes in circulation across London to help you get around quickly and easily.

        The scheme includes south-west London, so now you can saddle up anywhere from Shepherd's Bush to Canary Wharf, and Wandsworth Town to Camden Town.

        Santander Cycles bikes are available for hire at the docking-station terminal with a bank card or contactless payment card – just touch the screen and follow the instructions to begin.

        Getting started is easy: simply hire a bike, ride it where you like, then return it to any of the hundreds of docking stations across the city.

        It costs £2 to access the bikes for 24-hour bike access, and the first 30 minutes of each journey is free. Longer journeys cost £2 for each additional 30 minutes.

        Remember, if you aren’t using a bike, dock it. You can hire a bike as many times as you like within the bike access period you have purchased.<sup> <a href="reference.html">11</a></sup>
