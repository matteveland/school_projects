Write a SELECT statement that answers this question:
What is the total quantity purchased for each product within each category? Return these columns

The category_name column from the category table
The product_name column from the products table
The total quantity purchased for each product with orders in the Order_Items table

Use the WITH ROLLUP operator to include rows that give a summary for each category name as well as a row that gives the grand total.

Use the IF and GROUPING functions to replace null values in the category_name and product_name columns with literal values if theyâ€™re for summary rows.
